I've already mention <strong>screen</strong> before and I've been using screen for a while, if you don't know what screen is you should really <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">google it</a>, it's a great tool for terminal lovers like me.

I think OSX comes with screen by default since the upgrade to the terminal app. The problem with the installed version is that it doesn't allow vertical split, only horizontal. I searched in ports for something like screen-vs but I couldn't find anything. So I started looking for a manual installation and I got it, here it is:

<pre class="brush: bash">
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/screen co screen
$ curl http://old.evanmeagher.net/files/gnu-screen-vertsplit.patch &gt; gnu-screen-vertsplit.patch
$ cd screen/src
$ patch &lt; ../../gnu-screen-vertsplit.patch
$ ./configure --enable-locale --enable-telnet --enable-colors256 --enable-rxct_osc
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

After the installation you can hit <em>C-a |</em> or run <em>split -v</em> in command line mode.
