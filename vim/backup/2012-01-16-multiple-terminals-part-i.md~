Maybe you want many terminals on the screen. You can do that, just open each one you and drag and resize until you get them in the right place. 
<!-- more start -->
Now you can navigate them width CMD-NUM. My point is: all thie dragging around is annoying, so I got some solutions:

* Screen
* ITerm 2
* Divvy

###Divvy

So my first is Divvy. As it says:

>"It allows you to quickly and efficiently 'divvy up' your screen into exact portions."

Divvy allows you to resize each window into portions of screen. I usually split the screen into four, having four terminals, or three and adium.

To get full potential out of Divvy I've created some shortcuts (Alt+A, Alt+S, Alt+Z and Alt+X) to the same sized screen portions in divvy. I have other to fullscreen (Alt+R), middle of the screen (Alt+T) little right top corner (Alt+E). And I have more, you get the ideia. Here are some screenshots:
