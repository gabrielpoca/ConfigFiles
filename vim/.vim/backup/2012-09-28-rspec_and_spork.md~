When the wait time was too much I found [Spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork). I've run `time rspec spec --drb` and here is the before and afeter.
<!--more-->
The before

	Finished in 1.58 seconds
	54 examples, 0 failures

	real	0m6.372s
	user	0m5.519s
	sys	0m0.819s


And after


	Finished in 2.01 seconds
	54 examples, 0 failures

	real	0m2.568s
	user	0m0.304s
	sys	0m0.061s

The after is about 30% of the before! Yes, it's worth it.
