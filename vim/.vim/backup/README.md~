### NIOPeer
This project is peer where each peer listens to one port for the mutex and sends it through the other.
Each peer also listens for local connections. Each local connection is trying to aquire the mutex.
If there is no local connection the mutex keeps be sent in the ring.
Each peer is implemented with two threads the act as a nio server each.
