So today I managed to connect Irssi to Facebook Chat through Bitlbee. First things first, get Irssi and Bitlbee.
<!--more-->

	sudo port install irssi
	sudo port install bitlbee

Then configure bitlbee.

	cp /opt/local/etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf.sample /opt/local/etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf

Open bitlbee.conf and search/edit to `RunMode = ForkDaemon`. Now start bittlbee and irssi.

	bitlebee
	irssi

Right now you're in irssi's console mode. Run the following to get things working. These commands should be easy to understand.

	/connect localhost
	account add jabber username@chat.facebook.com password

The following renames friend list default names to readable names.

	account fb set nick_source full_name

Start the chat.

	account on

And it is done. Now you should learn about irssi. Quick tip to start a conversation:

	/query Name

To chat in a new window run `/window new hide` before.
Bellow is a screenshot of mine.
