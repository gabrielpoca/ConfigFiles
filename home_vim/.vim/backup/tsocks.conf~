# This is the configuration for libtsocks (transparent socks)
# Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored
#
# The basic idea is to specify:
#	- Local subnets - Networks that can be accessed directly without
#			  assistance from a socks server
#	- Paths - Paths are basically lists of networks and a socks server
#		  which can be used to reach these networks
#	- Default server - A socks server which should be used to access 
#			   networks for which no path is available
# Much more documentation than provided in these comments can be found in
# the man pages, tsocks(8) and tsocks.conf(8)

# Local networks
# For this example this machine can directly access 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 
# (192.168.0.*) and 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 (10.*)

#local = 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
#local = 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

# Paths
# For this example this machine needs to access 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0 as 
# well as port 80 on the network 150.1.0.0/255.255.0.0 through
# the socks 5 server at 10.1.7.25 (if this machines hostname was 
# "socks.hello.com" we could also specify that, unless --disable-hostnames
# was specified to ./configure).

#path {
#	reaches = 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0
#	reaches = 150.1.0.0:80/255.255.0.0
#	server = 10.1.7.25
#	server_type = 5
#	default_user = delius
#	default_pass = hello
#}

# Default server
# For connections that aren't to the local subnets or to 150.0.0.0/255.255.0.0
# the server at 192.168.0.1 should be used (again, hostnames could be used
# too, see note above)

#server = 192.168.0.1
# Server type defaults to 4 so we need to specify it as 5 for this one
#server_type = 5
# The port defaults to 1080 but I've stated it here for clarity 
#server_port = 1080 



# Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored

# This sample configuration shows the simplest (and most common) use of
# tsocks. This is a basic LAN, this machine can access anything on the
# local ethernet (192.168.0.) but anything else has to use the SOCKS version
# 4 server on the firewall. Further details can be found in the man pages,
# tsocks(8) and tsocks.conf(5) and a more complex example is presented in
# tsocks.conf.complex.example

# We can access 192.168.0. directly
local = 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
local = 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
local = 193.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
local = 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255

# Otherwise we use the server
# eles mudaram o ip sem avisar, o novo ip est√° na linha de baixo
# server = 193.137.16.74
