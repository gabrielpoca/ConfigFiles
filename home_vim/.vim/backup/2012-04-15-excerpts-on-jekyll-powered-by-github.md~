I'm now creating my blog on Github Pages with Jekyll. I was trying to get excerpts on my index page, but Jekyll doesn't allow it and Github pages doesn't allow plugins.
<!-- more start -->
So I found, forgot where, a way around. Just replace 

\{\{ post.content \}\} 

in you posts loop by


\{\{ post.content | replace:'more start - ->','' | replace:'<\!- - more end','' \}\}


Now,in your posts, you should put the tag <\!- - more start - -> where the excerpt should end and <\!- - more end - -> in the end of the post. Notice that these are the html's comment tags, I couldn't manage to join the two -.
<!-- more end -->
